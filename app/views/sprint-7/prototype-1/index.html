        Cyber health framework
      </h1>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Welcome to the Cyber Health Framework for local authorities in England. This framework has been developed by MHCLG to support local authorities to:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Understand the levels of cyber security they should be reaching</li>
        <li>Determine their own organisationâ€™s level of cyber security</li>
        <li>Devise a path to build greater resilience</li>
        <li>Achieve their PSN and NHS DSTP compliance</li>
        <li>See how they map against other common standards, including Cyber Essentials, Cyber Essentials + and ISO 27001</li>
      </ul>
      <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">
        Progression levels
      </h1>
      <p class="govuk-body">The framework includes three levels of cyber health progression, and is designed to encourage continuous cyber improvement. The three levels are:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li><span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Level 1 (Baseline): </span> this is the minimum level that all local authorities should be meeting.</li>
        <li><span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Level 2 (Target): </span> this level includes additional controls that local authorities should put in place to mitigate against more technically capable cyber attacks.</li>
        <li><span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Level 3 (Advanced): </span> this level is encouraged for local authorities facing the most advanced cyber or network and information security threats, or those providing the most essential public services.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Each progression levels maps to specific compliance processes or standards, which means by achieving each progression level you will also be meeting those requirements:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li><span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Level 1: </span>  Cyber Essentials, Cyber Essentials +</li>
        <li><span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Level 2: </span> PSN and IT Health Checks, PCI DSS, GDPR Security Outcomes</li>
        <li><span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Level 3: </span> ISO 2700, NIS-CAF</li>
      </ul>
